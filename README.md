### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

The colours where choosen to reflect a modern feeling. The combination of Night and Gold gives the website modern look and it is easy on the eye. The colour palette was created with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).  

### Typography

Google Fonts and FontJoy were used for the following:

- Fira Sans Condensed is used for logo and shorter text.
- Oswald is used for headings.
- Robot is used for the body text of the website.

I think this pairing provides a balanced and visually pleasing contrast.
